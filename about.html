		<h1>About</h1>

		<h2>Rural Virtual Academy</h2>
		<p>RVA is a free public school based in Medford, Wisconsin. Students can open-enroll to up to three schools of their choice, not in their school district, and it is up to the school to accept or decline them. RVA tries to accept as many students as possible and hires teachers based on which grades are wanted. High schoolers graduate with a state diploma, just like at their local public school. And as a public school, it is free to any Wisconsin school-age resident.</p>
		<p>Besides schooling, RVA also offers virtual and in-person field trips at least once a month in each of their districts across the state. Past field trips have included bowling and pizza, the movie Wonder in theaters (with soda and popcorn), Milwaukee Brewers game, waterparks, and many more. They also offer a wide variety of clubs, such as LEGO, D&D, Battle of the Books, chess, and more.</p>

		<h2>Claire G.</h2>
		<p>I have been a student for 5 years and truly appreciate everything they have done to accommodate my family and me, and our unique situation. Every teacher I have had is helpful and supportive and cares about me and my struggles and achievements in school and out. I highly recommend RVA to anyone in Wisconsin and is looking for an alternative to a traditional public school.</p>
